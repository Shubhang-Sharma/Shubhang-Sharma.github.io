        I am a final year master's student at National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) Bhubaneswar. I am fascinated by the mathematical problems which are connected to theoretical Physics - for example, see <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~jbm18/ijg/notes/introtogaugetheory.pdf">Gauge theory</a> or <a href="https://people.math.harvard.edu/~jeffs/symplectic.html">Symplectic Geometry</a>. These directions are epitome of arenas where both math and physics could be understood rigorously, often helping both the fields. I have been studying some of these directions on my own but now I decided to pause that hustle since the path was shabby and am waiting for the break year to carve my own path. For my master's thesis, I am working on AdS/CFT correspondece with Dr. Yogesh Shrivastava who also taught us two Quantum Field Theory courses. I like to cycle and run and recently even playing frisbee. I am also a passionate consumer of Film, 3D/Web Art and Music. <i>I make art without being an artist.</i> 
        <!-- To be more precise, if Life was a bundle I enjoy looking at the fibers of it (in my own way). I am lucky to meet couple of other <i>fiberists of life</i> - <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/trivikramudu/home?authuser=0">Trivikram</a> and <a href="https://www.notion.so/abhasjournal/Journal-cb09bb7d45aa469885a122dadc45ffa0?pvs=4">Abha</a>, having their own style.  -->

        This site is built using simple HTML and CSS. The blog styling is automated using Jekyll. Thanks to websites of <a href="https://11de784a.github.io/about">Ayush Singh</a> and <a href="https://mjeffs.net/">Maxim Jeffs</a> for the inspiration. </p> 
        <p>Lately I am curious about web and game development as a medium of art. I am planning to use these media to express the physical and mathematical theories. Currently I have decided not to apply for PhD after my master's, and instead spend an year exploring things - <i><a href="\fields\2024\08\17\foundation_year.html">a foundation year</a></i>.</p>
