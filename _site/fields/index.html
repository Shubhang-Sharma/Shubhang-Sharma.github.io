        <p>So, I am stressed about the meeting with my Thesis supervisor. I was not able to work on my thesis properly in the last week. Although I did work a little. Most of my stress comes from the fact that I tend to have ambitious goals of understanding viz. a huge list of fundamental topics to understand first before going furhter. The next topic I need to learn about is how fields behave under Conformal Transformations. Looking at the chapter 4 of Francesco’s Conformal Field Theory book, I realized I need to study the symmetries subchapter of chapter 2 too. And I was not able to read it since I felt like I was under a time crunch.</p>

        <p>I clearly am facing the consequences of a mind out of practice, a mind out of mindfulness, a mind succumbded to the worldly stress. I could see myself coming out of the practicing mind, but I neglected it. I now see clearly the consequences.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of my second year in college just after chosing to major in Physics, I used to wonder - <em>how could one possibly learn all the fundamental physics developed in the last couple of centuries?</em> Well, as it turns out, it isn’t. You can only accept some of it and move on.</p>

        <p>So, I’ve been working on creating a routine and adopting good habits to make sure I’m going towards where I want to be in life. I thought I should give Atomic Habits a listen - and that’s what I did in the last week or so. It’s a great book. I wrote about it in my previous post.</p>

        <p>Yesterday’s <a href="/artreview/2024/05/20/peach_blue_clouds.html">painting</a> of Abha left me feeling a lot of things. I really want to know how it feel like, when one paints, or sketches. The sheer action of putting something one imagines or sees onto a piece of paper is crazy. This paiting is making me feel things inside that I’m not able to express… I don’t know how to deal with it. I should probably spend more time looking at it, so that I can reach an equilibrium. Or should I even aim to reach an equilibrium?  Why should the charms of the piece be finished? May be I will let things be how they are now. Ah askjfskdgjg.</p>
