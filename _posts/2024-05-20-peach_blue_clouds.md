_The peach, the blue and the clouds_. This painting threw me in an artistic zone. I wish I could describe how I am feeling. I am tempted to ask the creator of their processing behind this piece. But I am afraid I shall collapse my artistic feeling. An art piece creates a beautiful experience of our having our own interpretation/feeling, and seeking the artist for their idea behind, doesn't feel right. I think that's how we should see art as. Nothing more than uncertain interpretaions. Nothing concrete. It sounds like we are distancing ourselves from the creator and having our own feelings. Maybe artists do that, they don't believe in _right interpretations_. They only look for interpreations. The process of consuming and interpreting the artwork is art. Not just the original creation of it.
